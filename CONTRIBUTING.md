## Running the App

Use `npm run start` or any of the other start commands to run the CLI (see [CLI section of the README](./README.md#cli)).

## Running Tests

First, you have to generate the coverage reports for testing using `npm run test:generate-data`.
Afterwards you can run the tests proper by using `npm run test` or any of the other test commands like `npm run test:debug`.

See also [test-data/README.md](test-data/README.md).
